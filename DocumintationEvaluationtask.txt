In this project I did
firt I create new repository in GitHub
then I create new project in e-clips i name it( evaluationtask) 
I create a 4 classes the first one is ( Api ) for calling the function , the other three classes I write the method 
and function (definition) only  for ( Consume API,WriteResponse , SearchWord ) .

in the Api class I create one function for the menue ( mainMenue() ) then I write menue for Consume API,WriteResponse ,
 SearchWord , Exit the system . 
 I did While loop for the menue to repeat and ask again .
I create switch cases for the menue .
the first case for consume API , by object chaining.giving object for the class then call the name of the function.
the output was 
[{"id":316,"type":"general","setup":"Why are mummys scared of vacation?","punchline":"They're afraid to unwind."},
{"id":353,"type":"general","setup":"Why didnâ€™t the orange win the race?","punchline":
"It ran out of juice."},{"id":99,"type":"general","setup":"Did you hear that the police have 
a warrant out on a midget psychic ripping people off?","punchline":"It reads \"Small medium at large.\""}
,{"id":5,"type":"general","setup":"Why can't bicycles stand on their own?","punchline":"They are two tired"},{"id":47,"type":"general",
"setup":"Don't look at the eclipse through a colander.","punchline":"You'll strain your eyes."},{"id":255,"type":"general",
"setup":"What is a vampire's favorite fruit?","punchline":"A blood orange."},{"id":53,"type":"general",
"setup":"How do you make holy water?",
"punchline":"You boil the hell out of it"},{"id":321,"type":"general","setup":"Why can't you use \"Beef stew\"as a password?",
"punchline":"Because it's not stroganoff."},{"id":314,"type":"general","setup":"Why are ghosts bad liars?",
"punchline":"Because you can see right through them!"},
{"id":126,"type":"general","setup":"How do you get a baby alien to sleep?","punchline":" You rocket."}] 

the second case for WriteResponse , by object chaining.giving object for the class then call the name of the function.
the third case for SearchWord , by object chaining.giving object for the class then call the name of the function.
the last case for the end and exit the system.

in class ConsumeApi shows the code for consuming API by adding URL for random api user.
